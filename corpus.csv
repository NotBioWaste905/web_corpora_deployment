"My 3.5 year old boy loves all Pixar movies, as do I. Cars 2 should be rated PG, not G, as it IS very violent. Guns, explosions, and killing/death are what the entire movie consists of, oh yeah and racing. We are trying to limit the amount of violence/weapons our son intakes. If you remember, even in Toy Story, Woody never had a gun in his holster, always empty. I don't necesarily mind that Pixar went this route cause it's not there job to cater to young children.

"I read the reviews here before I decided on going for the movie. Judging by the low score here, I assumed it would be a pretty flat movie but I was pleasantly surprised! Not only is this movie as good as the first, in some respects its even better. The only reason I would suspect that this movie got a low score here is that its a bit too involved to be a pure kiddy movie. Its actually got all the pizazz of a James Bond flick and plenty of laughs thrown in as well.

Cars 2 is basically the first Cars with a sprinkle of The Fast and the Furious. This was an experiment that Pixar has never done before and I respect that. Just because Cars 2 isn't a heartwarming Toy Story 3 doesn't mean that it is bad.

"Okay, let me re-explain what you probably know; Cars 2 is widely being considered as Pixar's worst. This is true. It's also being widely considered as a bad film. This is not true. I personally believe this is another great film from Pixar, it just plunges a little more into the Dreamworks tub. The story revolves around Mater, rather than Lightning McQueen, a mixed decision in my opinion. On one hand, Lightning McQueen is a bland character, with little personality. And Mater, while much more interesting and defined, is also extremely one dimensional, and that really shows when he becomes the star of the show. Mater is mistaken as an American spy by two secret agents, Flinn McMissile and Holly Shiftwell. Mater then takes part in many missions, while the two secret agents have no idea he's just a regular tow truck. In the meantime, Lightning McQueen is on a World Grand Prix in hopes of beating the **** Francesco. There's a bit more to the plot than this, but that's the gist of it. The film certainly looks like a Pixar film. The animation is easily Pixar's best; appearing more detailed than that of Toy Story 3, and the various race/spy scenes give the movie a chance to show what it can do. Some things look impeccably real (in the last 20 minutes of the film, take a look at the trees). The film sounds like a Pixar movie too. The musical soundtrack is performed masterfully by Michael Giacchino. Also, the voice talents have been selected carefully, just as in all Pixar films. The original voice actors are back (though due to the death of two characters, Fillmore's voice has been replaced and Doc is deceased), though most of them get few appearances. Also, John Ratzenberger (who gets a role in every Pixar film) has an infestimal role in this film: only two lines. So, the film sounds and looks like a Pixar, but it doesn't feel like one. Compared to the other Pixars, the story is weak and disappointing. Also, there is none of the heart and emotion that made the other Pixars so lovable. There's little adult-kid balance, so most parents won't be watching with their kids, which is completely opposite of other Pixars, where parents may enjoy the film more than the kids. I said earlier that this film is more like a Dreamworks movie. This is because of the lack of emotion, the shallow story, and the kid appeal. Even the humor is a little more Dreamworks oriented, a lot of it being roll-your-eyes kind of humor, and there's even some potty humor. That's not to say you won't laugh; there are plenty of amusing bits, but overall, it pales in comparison to Pixar's previous efforts. Concluding, this is Pixar's worst film, hands down. However, it's still a great film, although flawed. It's certainly not a must see like the other Pixars, but it's good enough. Just don't do this to us again, Pixar: I won't be quite as forgiving.",Cars 2,Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures,"June 24, 2011","['Comedy', 'Animation']",7,LandF,"Apr 19, 2012",https://www.metacritic.com/movie/cars-2/user-reviews
"Star racecar Lightning McQueen and the incomparable tow truck Mater take their friendship to exciting new places in ""Cars 2"" when they head overseas to compete in the first-ever World Grand Prix to determine the world's fastest car. But the road to the championship is filled with plenty of potholes, detours and hilarious surprises when Mater gets caught up in an intriguing adventure of his own: international espionage. Torn between assisting Lightning McQueen in the high-profile race and towing the line in a top-secret spy mission, Mater’s action-packed journey leads him on an explosive chase through the streets of Japan and Europe, trailed by his friends and watched by the whole world.

"Like the first, this was not great but not very bad either. The transition from the ""Hot-shot comes to small town and learns life lessons"" theme of the first to a spy movie was a bit odd but there were still some entertaining gags. Mater was a great part of the first so it was nice to see him get more screen time. And it was clever to have the James Bond parody be an Aston Martin but it was a bit weak in parts. Perhaps this wouldn't be a problem if we hadn't come to expect so much from Pixar but we have. Who knows-maybe Cars 3 will be better. Maybe it'll be a third time lucky situation.

"Pixar is the standard bearer for animated movies that appeal equally to children and adults, and this is no exception. There has yet to be a Pixar film that doesn't make more than $100 million or score a devoted following from both critics and audiences. The animation is gorgeous, the action sequences crisp, the voice acting impeccable, and the inside jokes funny. Cars 2 is not a masterpiece when stacked up against the Toy Story sequels, but it's a fun summer spectacle that will make kids think about what it means to really be yourself, even when there's pressure to change.Mater is now the protagonist, and the world is the setting; while that expands the action and the automobile humor (geisha cars, the Queen as a vintage Rolls, and Prince Wheeliam as a Bentley), it does limit the amount of time that we spend with our old friends from Radiator Springs. Caine and Emily Mortimer are perfectly cast as the British intelligence agents who mistake Mater for an American spy, but in the end, this is Larry the Cable Guy's shining moment.",Cars 2,Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures,"June 24, 2011","['Comedy', 'Animation']",10,ceb1031,"Jun 28, 2017",https://www.metacritic.com/movie/cars-2/user-reviews
"Ratatouille, Wall.E, The Incredibles, Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc, Up: the list of beloved Pixar movies is long. One of the few that’s almost never cited is Cars. But John Lasseter’s one-dimensional and visually sub-stellar 2006 tribute to American auto culture did rake in an awful lot of merchandise money. Its reboot, Cars 2 – is equally so-so.The last film was a tribute to Route 66, the American west and a 1951 Hudson Hornet. It was set in Radiator Springs, a place that its hero Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson) dismissed at first as “hillbilly hell” before learning to love its decent, old-school ways. In Cars 2, Lasseter and co-director Brad Lewis have gone down the export route, relocating the action to Italy, Japan and swinging London.McQueen heads to these cities to compete in a World Grand Prix organised by oil tycoon Miles Axlerod (Eddie Izzard) as a showcase for his alternative energy business. He’s accompanied by pal Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), a rusty pick-up truck, who initially embarrasses him, but later, when it turns out that a plan has been hatched to blow up the champ, saves him with feats of bravery and ingenuity.",Cars 2,Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures,"June 24, 2011","['Comedy', 'Animation']",10,lrbohnert,"Nov 25, 2016",https://www.metacritic.com/movie/cars-2/user-reviews

"Now this movies had (still gets)some pretty bad press and reviews, and I can see why but it's really not all that bad. Pretty good movie actually with beautiful animation, good music, interesting scenes and places, international race cars, Lightning McQueen and the it showed more of the Car world.The spy stuff and the plots involving oil, new fuel types, car discrimination and friendship might go over some kids heads but it is also rather interesting if you study it more. The only real issue that I have is with the character, Mater, himself. I am not a big Mater fan, of his personality type or humour but I can see why he appeals to kids and others, so maybe that's why he's the real star of this film.Basically the film revolves around a plot to turn people (the cars) towards a new fuel type that's supposed to be better for them, and an international race is there to promote the fuel. However, the new fuel is really just gasoline and by making the new fuel look bad, by hurting the racers using the fuel, the cars behind all this hope to turn people back to oil ( there's a huge new secret oil field discovered by these guys early o in the film)and get rich and powerful. The cars doing this are 'lemon' cars or ones who are not well made and break down frequently and get made fun of.So they feel rather angry at the world for their poor treatment.There are also spies (the good guys) from Britain, America, etc ( A rather James bond like one and a pretty purple Jaguar type)and Mater basically gets mixed up in all this whilst Lightning races against a heap of other racers, though this really isn't paid as much attention to as it should have been. It all ends with mater uncovering the lead villain, making up with McQueen after an argument and has messages like be yourself and accept others. Good messages for children I suppose. The movie made me smile and laugh with it's over the top nonsense and beautiful animation, as well as amusing my nephew and nieces. The main issue though (with many people) is still Mater and his bumbling ways, the lack of attention to the races and Lightning, plus there was some violence like the American spy getting blown up and the racers engines blowing out from a lazer but I have seen worse. Anyone remember Littlefoot's mother being injured and dying? Now that's painful and scary cartoon violence. There was also the fact that Lightning doesn't win in any major races and the other characters from Radiator Springs felt like they were put in just to fill space.plus for a movie promoting international race scenes they only went to 3 places, whilst if you look at the Cars 2 artbook you can see that various other types of races (endurance, outback and ice) were planned, in a variety of places like Russia and Germany. Why Pixar didn't focus more on or include these is beyond me. It would have appealed to many to see more races, race types and countries I think and less of the Mater/spy stuff.Still I do like the film and it isn't a depressing disappointment like Cars 3 is, so 8/10 for me. 2 of for Mater I'm afraid though.",Cars 2,Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures,"June 24, 2011","['Comedy', 'Animation']",8,ladychaos,"Nov 22, 2017",https://www.metacritic.com/movie/cars-2/user-reviews

"Clear, concise, intelligent and humorous - such is Cars 2. Cars was never my favorite Pixar, but coming out of the theater after seeing the sequel, I found myself smiling over a clever, well-thought, simply entertaining film. There is no deep, emotional story, but for entertainment this is by far extremely enjoyable. The humor is intelligent (not crude, suggestive or shallow like so many other animated films), the story moves at a solid, easy to understand pace and the characters are engaging. Mater is a character that is easy to root for with his positive outlook on life and his compassion toward everyone around him. When it comes to giving a good example of a nonjudgmental attitude, Mater is hard to beat. Finn McMissile has many of the typical spy characteristics, but goes beyond what we stereotypically think of the ""James Bond"" character by showing kindness and respect toward others. He openly admits his own shortcomings/need for help, while remaining debonair through it all. He doesn't even show the womanizing side so easily associated with the ""spy world"" and instead shows his female counterpart a great deal of respect.  Kudos to Pixar for their work on these characters. There is lots of ""eye candy"" in the depth of animation and the creative little touches to background motifs that make this world truly and mechanically unique. After seeing the film numerous times on various screens, I am still catching the little details placed in the film - all of which have never been of any suggestive nature inappropriate for a general viewing audience. This film also allows us a chance to look at some of our little idiosyncrasies in a fun way and gives positive messages such as friendship, compassion and honesty. While not for everyone - a caution to families with young children due to intense action sequences and suggested deaths - for older children through adults, Pixar's continued show of intelligent film making sets it apart from all other animation companies regardless of where the awards land.  As for what I witnessed during my various visits to the theater for this film, everyone was fully engaged - laughing, cheering and generally having a good time. We all left with smiles, which I think says a lot for the film.

"I honestly don't understand why this movie has taken such a beating. Personally, it's my least favorite Pixar movie, and it does have its share of problems, but I still enjoyed it. Why? Because I knew it wasn't meant be a tear-jerking masterpiece like Up or Toy Story 3 - it was meant to be a simple, fun, summer comedy. And it succeeds at that. It doesn't have to be emotional or profound in order to be good. It's nice to take a break from all that crying for a change! (Not that there's anything wrong with Pixar movies making you cry.) Sure, it's not Pixar's best by a long shot, but just because it isn't the next WALL-E or Toy Story or Finding Nemo doesn't mean that it isn't good.

"Cars 2 is Pixar's worst film to date, but that doesn't mean it's bad. It is a good film, but not a lot more, as some of the comedy isn't very funny and the plot isn't exactly top of the line. My main complaint of the film however is that it feels disjointed, giving you no time to get adjusted to ""Lightning's"" storyline, while also at times not giving you enough time to really get into ""Mater's"" storyline. It's odd that they shifted the focus of the main protagonist to Mater, which, while isn't necessarily bad, some will find it very off-putting. The film is fun, and this is where it holds up, making it a 6/10, also it has a good plot twist that I did not see happening at all. All in all, it's a fun film that shouldn't be overlooked, but it should really be called something like ""Cars: it's Materin' Time!"" as the story revolves around Mater, giving a fun Spy based film with explosions and everything, but certainly no Pixar masterpiece like we should be getting given their track record.",Cars 2,Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures,"June 24, 2011","['Comedy', 'Animation']",6,Happymonk,"Jul 11, 2012",https://www.metacritic.com/movie/cars-2/user-reviews

"This film had a very compelling story, a relatable cast of characters, and beautiful settings. The spy plot complemented the story very well, I thought the shift of focus from McQueen to Mater was done perfectly. I really liked characters like Francesco and Finn. The film begins with an exciting and suspenseful scene on an oil rig, letting us know the character Finn will be, and giving us a taste of what the movie will be like. I also like the scene with the ""Lemon Party"" It was a very crucial and important scene that was very intense serious and suspenseful, this was complemented by Maters happy-go-lucky attitude. The film ends with Mater getting knighted in honor of his efforts to save London. This had to be one of the most beautiful moments in film history.

"There are some thoughts that people will think that they gonna hate the sequel, and so does the original that the audience won't like the premise of Cars. I know people likes it or hates it, but I have to say that Cars 2 was really fun to watch and it's very exciting adventure better than the first one. The only thing that I really like in this sequel is secret agents, countries, action, adventure, and new fancy places. That's all I really enjoy myself watching this. Anyways, the story is more better developed that they make a new idea for the sequel that Lighting McQueen and Mater are going to the international world cup to win the race and then there are two secret agent spies that are facing with the bad villain who wants to destroy the cars who filled with oil. The voice acting did great and I really enjoy the new characters that they can bring more fun and more exciting to be decent and cool. The animation is pretty cool and the action scenes were awesome. I really like when the cars are chasing around with guns, explosions, and high-tech gadgets in everywhere that they race. But for my opinion, that I take it back when this movie will not be exciting as now and there's more that they came from where people think it's gonna be suck, so it's nice to make a better sequel once again for making a better cars animation. They know exactly what they can do for it and those animators are having fun for it. So that case, see this movie and see how fun that this movie will take more advantage for better animation, if you think so.",Cars 2,Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures,"June 24, 2011","['Comedy', 'Animation']",8,DarkCritic,"Jun 24, 2011",https://www.metacritic.com/movie/cars-2/user-reviews
"My 3.5 year old boy loves all Pixar movies, as do I. Cars 2 should be rated PG, not G, as it IS very violent. Guns, explosions, and killing/death are what the entire movie consists of, oh yeah and racing. We are trying to limit the amount of violence/weapons our son intakes. If you remember, even in Toy Story, Woody never had a gun in his holster, always empty.  I don't necesarily mind that Pixar went this route cause it's not there job to cater to young children.

The audience, including myself, laughed out loud continually throughout the movie.  Overall it was at least just as good as the first movie, if not better.  As usual pixar runs away with superior animation.  There were lots of humor designed for kids and adults.  This time around the movie was more centered around Mator rather than Mcqueen.  I am going to go against the grain here and say that the plot and storyline were well laid out and put together quite well.

"There is absolutely NO way this film is a zero. Yes, it lacks the heart of the first one, yes Mater is the main character, and yes Larry the Cable Guy is an awful comedian, but this movie is still somewhat entertaining. For the record, if you hate Larry the Cable Guy, you probably will hate the movie as he gets about 80% of the screen time. There are a lot of things that kids will not get, but both of my daughters, 7 and 4, enjoyed it. It got a few chuckles out of me, and parts of it were pretty good. I actually really enjoyed how Pixar poked a little good natured fun at the James Bond franchise while trying to weave a story kids will enjoy. Still, rent it on DVD when it comes out, don't spend your money at a theatre to see this. As to the people who say the animation is terrible, I think you might have seen a different movie.

Cars 2 does not have the same flare or attachment to the story and characters as you would expect for a Pixar movie although the solid spy story and well used car puns keep this movie enjoyable.

Are you also going to tell me that movie is just too unrealistic!? When you see this movie, you should judge it by your children's faces afterwards and not by your issues with the plot or anything else. My 5-1/2 and 4 year old boys LOVED this movie and SO DID I!

"A VHS copy of the musical ""Hello, Dolly"" is the robot's most-prized possession. ""WALL-E"", a lonely earthbound portable garbage compactor, makes a recording of the duet ""It Only Takes a Moment"" because the song moves him, inspiring the machine to hold his own hand, in imitation of the characters who have fallen for each other, from a long-ago past when the planet was habitable. Nothing green grows on earth anymore. The detritus of human civilization, bearing a color scheme that's nearly monochromatic in its brownness, is all that's left. Overrun by trash, entire populations boarded vast spaceships, leaving WALL-E behind with the endless job of minimizing waste into stacked cubes, while the planetary refugees floated around space in what are, essentially, movable countries, displaced indefinitely from their homes. But what does hardware know about love? How can something made out of microprocessors and integrated circuits develop a consciousness? At what point in time did ""it"" evolve and become a ""he""? It's only a matter of time before robots like Eve(as in Adam &) supplant a human race made morbidly obese by generation upon generation of insentient living. Whereas ""WALL-E"" presents a dystopian take on our extrapolated planet that's easily identifiable, ""Cars 2""(and ""Cars""), obscures the nightmarish elements of a four-wheeled society through the audience's supposition that this largely inorganic world is an alternate one. Under closer scrutiny, ""Cars"" starts to look more and more Cronenberg-ian, in which the pornography of auto fetishism in ""Crash"" actually gets put into practice. Let's meet the Flintstones again. Similar to the animated series, with its parodic names like Rock Quarry and Cary Granite to corroborate the Jurassic Period setting, both films use car-centric names(Bob Cutlass, Brent Mustangburger) as a means of harmonizing its metal beings with this variant earth. But when it comes to places, in which Bedford becomes Bedrock,  the conversion process stalls in ""Cars 2"" stalls, leaving the names of Paris, Tokyo, and London in its original incarnation, and furthermore, the landmarks of the cities(for instance, the Eiffel Tower) remain unaltered. Where are we, exactly? In ""Planet of the Apes"", the astronaut learns that he traveled across time, not space, when he discovers Lady Liberty in ruins, decapitated and rusting, along the shoreline of what turns out to be the Atlantic Ocean. Dr. Zaius' best efforts to perpetuate the long-standing notion of simian superiority is undermined by a chimpanzee, the archaeologist Cornelius, who unearths artifacts which proves that apes evolved from man during his cave excavations in the forbidden zone. ""Cars"" shares with ""Planet of the Apes"" the same conspiracy: the suppression of evolution. While remaining silent on the subject of man, despite the cars' admission that dinosaurs existed, they give themselves away, therefore deeming full disclosure of the timeline a moot point. Unlike Dreamworks, whose ""Shrek"" films employ a lot of pop culture references, Pixar avoids such anachronisms(the post-modernism of pastiche) yet in ""Cars"", Kenny G.'s ""Songbird"" scores a cheap laugh when a car gang puts Mack to sleep with the easy-listening jazz, causing the truck to lose his precious cargo(Lightning McQueen). This instrumental, like the videotape in ""Wall-E"", proves that man existed. Quite possibly, he's the missing link. Bolstering this theory, a VW bus, an auto-hippie, without any spoofing appellation, names Hendrix, after a military jeep voices his displeasure with the metalized version of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"". This is our earth, not some near-identical equivalent, like the one in the Tim Burton remake, where the film ends with a man staring aghast at the Lincoln Memorial, augmented with ape-like features. These cars are partly human. Vestiges of their humanity can be glimpsed in their faces. In addition to the eyes, Lightning has a tongue, while Mater sports buckteeth like a hayseed. And somewhere in the recesses of their ""brains"", these evolved vehicles remember sex. In ""Cars"", Mater throws Lightning into a homosexual panic as the tow-truck uses his hook on the auto racing car's undercarriage(read; sodomy). Likewise, the spy in ""Cars 2"", as suggested by the double entendre inherent in the name Holly Shiftswell, denotes a woman who was mustard in the sack. Unlike ""Planet of the Apes"", perhaps the conspiracy is an extra-diegetic one. In ""Cars"", Sally waxes nostalgic about Radiator Springs in the fifties. This history runs concurrently with the our timeline. What if she's lying? What if the conspiracy is the film itself, in which the narrators, both omniscient and first-person are fallible? In the climactic race for the coveted Piston Cup(""Cars""), a blimp hanging over the stadium reads ""Light Year"". It's a clue. Exactly what year is it in this planet of the cars? Maybe these aren't Anno Domini times.",Cars 2,Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures,"June 24, 2011","['Comedy', 'Animation']",4,Shiira,"Aug  5, 2011",https://www.metacritic.com/movie/cars-2/user-reviews

"I have now seen the movie Cars 2 3 times and in between have refreshed my memory of Cars. Cars 2 is FANTASTIC!! It's funny, it's clever and it's the best sequel to any movie that has been produced in a very long time. I wondered where Lightning and the other wonderful characters would end up after Radiator Springs. Total props to the creative folks at Pixar! Once again the talented people there have transformed a surreal place, time and characters to a mind blowing realistic world.  To the people that have complained about taking the America out or not making McQueen the star attraction, for one, the movie is ""CARS 2."" Not Lightning McQueen. You all must have owned a lemon when you were much younger and you are bitter and jealous. For the ones that thought Cars 2 was ""violent"" for their children to see. I will not and would hope Disney would never apologize for the grown up interactions in the movie since Cars came out in 2006. Against your will your children have grown up and amazingly so did the characters and concept of the movie. Did your child enjoy ALL of the Shrek movies? What about the Toy Story movies? How about the Suite life of Zack and Cody? Regardless of what your personal, out of date opinion is of Cars 2 is, they seamlessly integrated new characters, an interesting mission with real world facts and may have even set up the chance for a spin off. What will you do then? Tell your child nothing changes? No one grows up? Good luck. Get over your self. Kids love this movie.

"Well Pixar has done it again. Cars 2 may not be the best Pixar has done , it is still fun to watch. Many new voice actors were brought in for this movie, Eddie Izzard, Jeff Gordon, Michael Caine, Jeff Garlin, Bruce Campbell and many others, my favorite was Michael Caine. Caine is good in most things, and this spy character he pulls off perfectly. AS with most Pixar movies the animation is top notch, and the final 25 minutes are great amounts of CG. The film does start out kind of stupid but it then gets really entertaining. My only gripe i have about the movie, is how it differs a lot from the first film, the first film was a racing movie and very heartwarming, this one is more of an action movie and spy movie than a racing movie, plus the plot is all over the place. But the comedy is still spot on with this movie, it still has all the original characters as the original, Mater, Sally, Flo, Ramone, Sarge, Filmore, Guido, Luigi, the only one not there is Doc Hudson. Now i was wondering how they were going to do Doc for the movie, if they were going to kill him off, or if they were going to get another voice actor for him like they did for Slinky in the new Toy Story. Speaking of Toy Story there is a fantastic short film before the movie that is about all the Toy Story 3 characters having a hawaian vacation. if you are looking for a decent animated film definitely check this out.",Cars 2,Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures,"June 24, 2011","['Comedy', 'Animation']",6,skeletonking123,"Sep 10, 2011",https://www.metacritic.com/movie/cars-2/user-reviews

"Cars 2 was a very emotional joyride that improved on the first story. It had very diverse set of appealing characters like Finn, Francesco, and all the new racers. This film had the most representation of any Pixar film. They had very colourful backgrounds that contrasted well with Mater's rusty shell. I liked the airplane scene, though short, it showed the development of Mater and McQueen's friendship. The animation quality became way better than the original Cars allowing for the animation of the many gadgets that Finn uses. Miles Axelrod, was a very cunning and well written character, the twist that he was the head lemon was hinted at throughout the whole movie and was beautifully implemented when it was revealed. And Cars 2 showed that Pixar know about ongoing racism and is not afraid to tackle it by the use of the ""lemons"". The lemons are oppressed and want to change, but the world is not kind. The social story of lemons was a very inspiring addition to the film. I recommend the people should watch this, young and old, it doesn't matter if you haven't seen Cars 1, everybody should watch this beautiful tale of action, espionage, emotion, society, and friendship. I watch Cars 2 a few times a day, that is how beautiful it is.The jokes were very funny and enjoyable, and there is a wonderful magical empowering score befitting a story like this. Mater reminds me of Steve Rogers when he said that ""I know what you're going through. everybody has been laughing at me my entire life too, but becoming powerful and rich beyond your wildest dreams ain't gonna make you feel better."" this has to be one of the best words spoken in film history, though the some of the lemons were not swayed, I was, and I live by those words.

"Watching Cars 2 is like being a kid again. Some say it's cash grabbing, Pixar selling out just so that Disney can sell toys, but when I was watching it all I saw was the animators' love for cars. This was made for fans and not for adult critics - how they reimagined locales and included all the different cars and vehicles. It does differ than most Pixar movies in that it's not as ""emotional"" or heart touching; I actually think other Pixar films are over rated and feel like they're always trying to force scenes to make adults cry or something. But the spy themed story was pretty complicated and very similar to say Quantum of Solace. Some people found Mater to be annoying and I thought so too at first but after repeated viewings I could understand him and his friendship with McQueen felt more real.

"Ok I agree that the animation is really good, but the complicated plot was definitely not made thinking of a young (little kids 3-8 year olds) Most of the reviews that gave them a 10 or a positive review was thinking as an adult but if you remember that this movie is supposed to be for little kids, they failed tremendously. I was completely shock with the amount of guns and violence, seriously for a pixar's movie, how can Disney allow this? As a mom of 3 little boys who adored cars and their whole world and my wallet was all about cars they really messed it up. They were frightened by all the gun power of the first 5 minutes and they were lost in the plot. Who ever made the plot (probably a James Bond Fan) totally forgot who his target  audience was, young children! Do NOT take your little kids to watch this movie unless they are over 8 probably or take them if you are one of those parents who could care less about the amount of violence their child's watchesThe toy story short at the beginning is the only true terrific thing about the movie and the animation, the technical part.",Cars 2,Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures,"June 24, 2011","['Comedy', 'Animation']",2,momof3boys,"Jun 28, 2011",https://www.metacritic.com/movie/cars-2/user-reviews
"This film is terrible. You may ask yourself, why did Pixar make a sequel to their objectively worst film ever? Why give Mater and Larry the Cable Guy, arguably the worst ""comedian"" ever, more screen presence? I'll tell you why. Cars has made 8 BILLION dollars in merchandise sales since it's release. Yes, 8 billion. $8,000,000,000. Really, they would be stupid not to make another one. They are, after all, a business. They're in it for the money. But they should seriously at least attempt to retain their artistic integrity. Since Cars, Pixar released not only their four greatest films, but four of the greatest animated films ever made. They broke their streak with this film. They're artistic geniuses, they're capable of so much more, yet they squander it on this trash. They sacrifice their honor in the name of the all-mighty dollar. So take your kids to see this piece of filth, buy them their Cars toys and backpacks and lunchboxes. Contribute to the artistic downfall of the greatest animation studio ever. This is a terrible film. I gave it an honest chance because Toy Story 3 was a sequel that outdid both of the previous films, proving Pixar can pull of cashgrabs while making a quality film, but this is a piece of trash. If Brave doesn't prove they can continue the quality we saw in movies like Wall-E and Up, I honestly will lose all faith in Pixar.",Cars 2,Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures,"June 24, 2011","['Comedy', 'Animation']",0,Selaphiel,"Jun 24, 2011",https://www.metacritic.com/movie/cars-2/user-reviews

"Let's start with this. I'm going to guess that Pixar did not devote enough effort to this movie. Given a cursory glance at the credits, it seemed unusually short for a Pixar movie, but I could've been distracted. Remember also that the release date was move up a year from the original 2012 release date for unknown reasons. It seems that Pixar is under pressure to get movies out every year, rather than focusing on quality, which is quite honestly, a disturbing trend. It shows in the movie as well. The story is a blend of a spy movie with the normal Pixar themes of ""don't ditch your friends"" etc. The spy sections work well. The normal Pixar themes feel forced and unnatural in the context of the plot. Mater has his moments, but is not a strong enough or deep enough character to carry the movie and ended up being very annoying towards the middle of the film. The animation is as always fantastic, the sets were awesome, the water physics are getting much better, can't complain much there. That being said, Cars 2 is still a pretty fun ride.

"The worst Pixar movie ever. This is Pixar's bottom of the barrel and I hope they never ever do a disaster like this anymore. I'd already said it: spin-offs or sequels with the comic relief from the previous movie as the protagonist are destined to be BAD and this movie proves me right, it's no exception.The plot has absolutely nothing to do with the previous movie and focuses on a ""James Bond"" kind of spoof, what a brilliant idea, Pixar. There's nothing emotional, there's nothing exciting, interesting, there's no cute message, there's no conflict, there's nothing ""Pixar"" in its writing, the magic this company has is absolutely missing in this and it's nothing than an hour and a half waste of time. This is not a movie that was made to tell a story that people from all ages can enjoy and get something from, this is a soulless product that was made because Disney and Pixar want to sell more Cars toys and make a movie just with the money in mind without caring about anything else is the worst thing any filmmaker can ever do, it's the most deadly sin in cinema.Cars 3 is a far superior movie (Still not a great movie) and it's what this movie should've been in the first place.",Cars 2,Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures,"June 24, 2011","['Comedy', 'Animation']",0,BrunoVn00,"Apr  1, 2019",https://www.metacritic.com/movie/cars-2/user-reviews

"Every great album has dynamic contrast... just like Pixar's now 20 year + output. Don't let the naysayers fool you. Cars 2 is an amazing action movie with heart and smarts and so much soul. There is so much depth in this movie. I don't know how anyone could miss it. The movie does rehash some action, comedy and spy movie conventions, but what it also does is keep you invested in the characters - especially Mater. I never knew I could care so much for a rusty old tow truck! I think that anyone with an open mind to culture and diversity will embrace Mater as the lead, and invest in his character arc. In my opinion, the critics who are giving this movie poor reviews are not only missing the point, but are being left in the dust by John Lasseter's craft. Not every movie has to be Wall-E (which I ADORE) or some pretentious, art-house bag of air to have innovation, heart, soul and intelligence. Cars 2 is another milestone for Pixar.

"As a major Pixar-Disney film lover, this film crushed my heart into a million pieces.  I openly hated the first Cars film, but convinced myself this was Pixar's way of apologizing and making up for it.  Going into the film with incredibly low expectations (for both my memory of the first and poor reviews critically) the film was still worse than I would had anticipated.  The characters are one-note, we never see anything endearing about these characters or really get to know them on a personal level.  They do not have the instant lovable quality of any other characters which is not just because they are cars, Wall-E made robots look cute and cuddly after all.  For a studio as progressive as Pixar I found the portrayals of characters in the film to be stereotypical and unfair and bad representations of the countries in this film (as the plot takes place and features characters from around the globe.)  Mater is the single worst character in Pixar's history and it is a slap in the face that they made him an even larger part in the sequel, which is no doubt the worst film in Pixar's history, it should have been scrapped or made straight to dvd.  I have faith in them still, as I loved the Toy Story short before this atrocious film.

"There are many things that are just wrong with this movie. This movie was unwarranted. The first movie ended at a good note and didn't need any following, plus the story they went with is unnecessary. I don't know about most people, but I didn't need to see a movie where the characters travel to a World Grand Prix, which is pretty much a story line that could have been used as an epilogue for the first movie. The spy story line was fun for the first scene but quickly transformed into a pointless story line for the only purpose of giving Mater more screen time and creating situations that he can act ""wacky"" in. The movie also attempts to cover up the fact that it was made for money by making some half-assed message about friendship. However, the animation is great, which is no surprise for Pixar, so the whole movie is far from being ugly like some other animated movies (Gnomeo and Juliet for example).

By far the worst film ever released by Pixar, this one officially breaks their magic streak. They took all the heart and artistry of the first movie, and just chucked it out the window on their way to cashing in on all the merchandising possibilities. Owen Wilson may as well have not even shown up, because McQueen is relegated to a minor character in this film, as Mater becomes the centerpiece of a ridiculous (and almost completely unfunny) spy plot. Many reviewers have commented this was aimed at younger audiences than the first film, but no children's animated film you will see this year (or possibly ever) does more to glorify gun violence.Occasional glimmers of humor and clever touches are eclipsed by a bewildering, written-by-committee plot that tries to do too much and accomplishes too little.Upon leaving my 5 year-old son asked me ""What was that movie about...?""

"After a slightly disappointing run for Pixar in the last few years with movies like Monsters University and Cars 2, the power house of animation gives us their most thematically complex film since Wall-E. In Inside Out , the life of an eleven-year old girl named Riley is shown to be controlled by five voices inside her head: Joy, Sadness, Disgust, Fear, and Anger. They control her emotions and affect her memories, but Riley's life is thrown out of control when she moves to San Francisco. Her core memories, the most important ones, are thrown out of the control center as well as Joy and Sadness, so they have to journey back to put Riley's life back on track. The plot itself doesn't contain any big twists or even a villain. It's a seemingly simple tale with huge ambition. Showing what's going on in someone's head is a difficult feat, but Pixar achieves this in such a creative and original way. The ideas presented in Inside Out might fly over younger kids' heads, as there are some rather complex themes here: you can't be happy without experiencing sadness or anger or disgust or fear. They are natural parts of life. The film even deals with depression, identity, and self-worth. Inside Out is undeniably the most enjoyable, hilarious, and entertaining film that incorporates such heavy themes.

"Do you ever look at someone and wonder, ""What is going on inside their head?"" Well, the reality is the answers pretty dull. It's just a big brain sending messages across your body to determine your actions. But in the minds of the creators at Pixar the answer has no limits, with every persons head containing a fully functioning world, where small beings create and store every idea and memory we have in life. And at the centre of this world is a control panel, similar to something like the deck of the Enterprise, which is controlled by our emotions that lead us through every decision we make in our lives. Inside Out follows a girl named Riley (Katilyn Dias) and the five emotions that lead her every action- Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Riley's most important emotion that has shaped all of Riley's core memories that make her the person she is, Joy (Amy Pohler). They all care for Riley and one another like one big family, always looking to give Riley the best life she can have. This includes everything from remembering to avoid Broccoli to maintaining Riley's goofy attitude to remain her parents happy little girl. But Riley is entering a difficult period in her life of great change. She is moving to a new home in San Francisco, leaving her friends behind, and her father has become too busy with work to look after her the way he used to. This causes the emotions to conflict on the best way to deal with it, with the ensuing chaos causing Joy and Sadness to get lost in the furthest reaches of Riley's mind and forcing them to go on a journey to return to the control room, or Riley might never be happy again. In some ways the film is a nice reminder of how even after 20 years, Pixar has stuck to what made them so engaging to audiences to begin with. The journey that Joy and Sadness go on is a great buddy travel movie, that's in a similar vein to Buzz and Woody in 'Toy Story'. And just like 'Toy Story', Pixar has continued to remain focused on developing memorable characters that will help shape many childhoods, with the likes of Joy's energetic personality and simplistic but lovable design bound to stick in our heads the same way that Buzz Lightyear did when 'Toy Story' was first released. But in other ways the film is a reminder to show how far both Pixar and CGI animation has come, with the worlds Pixar's movies take place in going from the constraints of a child's bedroom to creating an entire world within the mind of a child. And the world that they create is something truly special. Other films have taken place in a person's mind in the past with their own distinct styles, from the epic mind bending action of 'Inception' to the fragmenting chaos in 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'. But no other film has ever approached the inner workings of a mind with the same creativity as Pixar has. The film includes as much as it could of developing how a mind works and what an 11 year old girl would be thinking about, incorporating it as either a great gag or as a way the world is designed to function. There's a literal train of thought that's able to carry memories across Riley's mind, a place called Déjà vu that keeps popping up, and even a dream centre that operates like a movie studio to give Riley something to watch at night. Even small sayings like getting a song stuck in your head are incorporated in to the film in some of Pixars funniest running gags to date. Plus I'm relatively certain that anyone who's seen the film will be humming Triple Dent Gum for the rest of their lives. As always, at the films heart remains the human drama that has kept Pixar movies so relatable over the years. In one of the most touching scenes, we watch as Joy turns on one of Riley's treasured childhood memories of her skating to pick up her spirits and slowly begins to skate with her in perfect synch. It's a beautiful moment where we're shown both the close bond that Riley and her emotions share, whilst reminding us all on the way we all hold on to out childhood in a way that only Pixar can. It's moments like this that can be universally related to, mixed with Pixar's stunning animation and their ability to create such original worlds that ensures Inside Out is another addition to Pixar's constantly growing collection of treasured classics.",Inside Out,Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures,"June 19, 2015","['Adventure', 'Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Comedy', 'Animation', 'Family']",9,Colginator,"Sep 15, 2015",https://www.metacritic.com/movie/inside-out-2015/user-reviews
"This was very good...but there was a bit in the middle where it seemed like the same reoccurring problems kept happening on their journey.   That part got repetitive.   Also, there are a lot of very emotionally sad things that happen through out the movie.  More sad things than happy things.  I would say that this movie is 60% sad and 30% happy and 10% indifferent.

"Inside Out is a very funny, charming movie.  It does have a few issues around it’s plot and a couple of it’s characters, but I would argue it’s worth the price of admission.  Pixar haven’t been this imaginative in a long time.  It’s a really cool world and I would definitely not call this an Osmosis Jones rip off!!  It has too much of it’s own identity in order to do that.  It’s really cute, really charming and it might actually get a bit of emotion out of you.  This is also not one just for the kids.  The adults will get something out of this.  Special props to Amy Poehler, Phyllis Smith, Lewis Black and Kaitlyn Dias who are all particularly good in their roles.  This won’t be for everyone and I imagine some people may struggle with this film, but I would say if you are willing to endure, it’s worth it.",Inside Out,Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures,"June 19, 2015","['Adventure', 'Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Comedy', 'Animation', 'Family']",9,NerdConsultant,"Aug  2, 2015",https://www.metacritic.com/movie/inside-out-2015/user-reviews
"'Inside Out' is the 15th feature from Pixar Animation Studios, and is directed by Pete Docter who also directed 'Monsters Inc' (2001) and the Oscar winning 'Up' (2009). 'Inside Out' focuses inside the head of a little girl named Riley, inside we meet the ""little voices"" and they are five different emotions. You have Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black) and Disgust (Mindy Kaling). They all control how Riley should feel and decide when it's an appropriate time for her to feel that emotion. Joy is the main emotion here, she is always concerned for Riley and wants her to have a good day, every day. The way Joy feels connected to Riley reminds me of the way Woody feels connected to Andy in the ""Toy Story"" franchise. She always wants the best for her, and when Riley feels something, Joy feels it too. 'Inside Out' is filled with some beautiful and colorful animation, a heart-wrenching story and some sympathetic characters. It's one of the best Pixar films since 'Toy Story 3' (2010). Whereas 'Cars 2' (2011), 'Brave' (2012) and 'Monsters University' (2013) failed to live up to expectations. There isn't a lot of comedy in this movie which can be worrying if you are a parent or guardian that's planning on taking your children off to a trip to the cinema. They would probably find 'Minions' (2015) more cheerful and silly, 'Inside Out' is mostly for adults to enjoy, there is nothing wrong with that, but children will no doubt find this movie very distressing. Pixar Animation Studios is very good at making their films enjoyable for adults, in that when you watch films like 'Toy Story' (1995), that film basically says ""We are all connected to our toys, remember when you were a child and had that one special toy?"", or 'Monsters Inc' (2001) would say ""When we were all kids, we all had those dreams of monsters creeping up in our bedrooms"". Pixar is good at tapping into an adult's childhood. But I don't want to sound too negative to this movie, maybe kids will enjoy it, all I am saying is, 'Inside Out' is in many ways a classic. A film to be remembered in years to come, I could see sequels and spin-offs based on this movie alone. It's definitely an Oscar winner for ""Best Animated Feature"", it is touching, inventive and just a gorgeous looking movie.",Inside Out,Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures,"June 19, 2015","['Adventure', 'Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Comedy', 'Animation', 'Family']",10,MrMovieBuff,"Jun 29, 2015",https://www.metacritic.com/movie/inside-out-2015/user-reviews
Hands down one of the best Pixar films in a very long time. The one and only thing I was confused about is the audience it is indented for.

"Pixar's best film yet! They flirt with the idea with emotions and what's going on in someone's head, It's smart and unique. Riley (Kaitlyn Dias) is eleven years old, she loves hockey and she's from Minnesota. Her world turns upside down, when she moves to San Francisco with mom and dad. Riley's emotions led by Joy (Amy Poehler) try to save her from this life changing event; the stress of Riley moving is bringing sadness (Phyllis Smith) to the forefront. Joy and Sadness are far behind Riley's mind, trying to get to headquarters meanwhile, Anger (Lewis Black) Fear (Bill Hader) and Disgust (Mindy Kaling) are struggling without Joy and Sadness.

"From the great minds at Disney/Pixar comes an animated comedy about all of our humble minds and the little voices in our heads, when 11 year-old Riley’s life takes a dramatic turn, the little creatures that control emotions do their best to help while embarking on perilous adventure through the fantasyland that is the human psyche. After the recent disappointments of the repetitive and one dimensional ‘Minions‘ and ‘Home‘, Disney & Pixar have once again set the standard for modern animation with a film that works on multiple levels and across generations, only this time the result is a delightfully written tale particularly effective for mature audiences, as individuals or families. The extensive writing team plus directors Pete Docter & Ronaldo Del Carmen manage to weave together a wonderfully inventive story that’s simultaneously a family comedy/drama, coming-of-age story and a fantastical adventure featuring creatures that personify human emotion within a fantastical world, which very cleverly makes tangible the complex notion of the human mind and how, quite literally, the “inside” fundamentally affects the “out”. ‘Inside Out’ does a commendable job of using complex psychological concepts like the subconscious and the intricacies of memory within an engaging narrative about the power and changeable nature of human emotion, all by framing them within characters that you’re rooting for from start to finish (both inside and out) and using humour with pathos while cleverly & hilariously implementing emotional references that everyone will relate to. No doubt this movie makes liberal and “creative” use of psychological concepts, even creating some of their own and it’s simplistic when it comes to the notion of emotional balance… and yes the film has an inherently sunny disposition and sentimentality that may not be for some, but it’s never over-the-top and always creatively handled with the result being surprisingly touching, ‘Inside Out’ may yet turn out to be a great way of teaching children (and adults) about their emotions as they grow the same way that Dr. Seuss’ book taught kids life-lessons while providing a moral compass. The Bottom Line…Clever, creative and engaging on many levels, ‘Inside Out’ is a wonderfully inventive adventure of the human psyche and surely another instant animated classic to add to the growing list from Disney & Pixar.",Inside Out,Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures,"June 19, 2015","['Adventure', 'Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Comedy', 'Animation', 'Family']",8,FilmPhonic,"Jul 24, 2015",https://www.metacritic.com/movie/inside-out-2015/user-reviews

What I like about it, the have a logical representation of time processing in a decision making. That's when we understand, why we do the things we do. This evaluation process, is skipped by immediate reasoning. Only few people will take time to emphatize. Prioritize other's feeling before them. This is what we loss when we are busy growing-up for the wrong selfish reason.Railey a twelve year kid, took the responsibility to deny herself the feeling of sadness; to make lighten-up her parents' burden.

"The return to Pixar golden age. Inside Out is original and brilliantly animated (as you would expect for a Disney film). It also has a beautiful and subtle soundtrack, which contributes to bring up the insane amount of emotion and honesty the movie displays. Even so, its best features rely on powerful imagery, cleverness and conceptual discussions: it is one of those movies you can watch several times and discover new things again and again. In a couple of moments, the movie might be excessively abstract and thematically challenging for small children (something I have never seen in a Pixar movie, their movies respect and don't underestimate kids as other animations. But in this one, subjectivity has reached new levels). However, it's nothing that can really harm the overall experience for them: at most, parents will like the movie more then the children.",Inside Out,Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures,"June 19, 2015","['Adventure', 'Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Comedy', 'Animation', 'Family']",9,grasso,"Aug  1, 2015",https://www.metacritic.com/movie/inside-out-2015/user-reviews
"This is one of the best movies for kids -- ever. This movie takes emotions head-on, and the utility of providing kids some kind of a mental map of how their emotions work is empowering and potentially life-changing. The movie is not perfect: emotions might play a huge role in our lives (especially kids), but they are not the only things that control us (though to be fair, the movie does not make the characters simply robots controlled by their emotions), and there are are a few minor stereotypes. However, the merits of Inside Out far-and-away outshine these foibles. Plenty of meaty issues to talk about, and even hints at more to come in kids lives. Shows emotions co-operating (and sometimes competing) to try for the well-being of their characters, and shows that everyone has emotions and that emotions can be complicated and nuanced. I can imagine that teens will pretend that they are not interested, so target audience would be 5 or 6 up to about 12. But if you can get your teenager to go, they will probably (internally) resonate with many of the issues and the way they are handled.

However, the story line did rely on some free spirited princess cliches that are a staple of Pixar’s parent company. The “planes” films are “Cars” spin off that have been universally panned by critics and it was very clear that these films were only meant for the youngest of audiences ( i.e. toddlers to six year olds). So when the trailer for Pixar’s latest outing came to theaters, many movie lovers (myself included) people were concerned with how this film was going to turn out. However as soon as the opening credits were over and the film proper had begun, it was very clear to me that Pixar had finally gotten back on its “A” game. “Inside Out” is not only a fun film that can be enjoyed by people of all ages, it is also a great insight on the nature of emotions and how all of them are nessacry in the development of a growing person.One of the first concerns that I personally had was that the emotions would only have one note personalities. For example, joy would be the generic quirky hero, fear would be the “geek”, Disgust would be the premdomina, sadness would only be able to express sadness and have it be it, and to have anger be the “hot-head” of the group. However, much to my surprise the writers have given the emotions their own distinct personalizes that have other elements of the other emotions. For example, Disgust shows a few instances of happiness when Reilly (their host) would have a chance to be happy with her move to San Francisco. It is only appropriate that the writers would have Reilly go through a move which would cause her to have an emotional breakthrough.  Moving is a position that many young viewers could relate and it is an emotional experience for children and adults. Moving is leaving everything that someone loves behind in order to live in a prosperous future. The change is very hard for young Reilly as she struggles to comprehend that the house that her family moves into is not really her dream house. With this drastic change, the emotions start to fight amongst themselves about what is best for Reilly. This makes for a compelling story since the negative emotions like anger and fear and even disgust really want to do what is best for their host.As the plot progresses, joy and sadness are separated from the rest of the emotions, they meet with Reilly’s old imaginary friend named Bing Bong who was forgotten by her as she grew older. As soon as he had come onscreen, I thought to myself “he is going to find a way to betray Sadness and Joy and then try to take over the mind so that he would be the only friend that Reilly would have. However, the film had made the choice to not throw in a last-minute villain, the film makers had decided to choose a more tragic route for the character. The character disappears towards the end of the film forever which symbolizes the end of childhood and that the emotions need to continue to prosper in the future to maintain Reilly’s emotional balance. It is for the better that the film doesn’t have a main villain, the girl going through her emotions is a strong conflict as it is. The surprise twist toward the end of the film shows the importance of negative emotions as well as positive emotions. The film teaches children (as well as adults) that negative emotions are needed for a balanced life. People cannot experience joy without going through the sadness. A negative experience could be seen as a challenge to help with self- improvementThere is a running gag in the film about the girl and every character in the film remembering a commercial jingle that keeps popping up in their mind. The gag is not only hilarious but it is also an interesting bit of social commentary. The commercial jingle is a slight reflection of how far people go to promote their product. The jingles were made to be as catchy on purpose so that the target audience could remember their product. Another interesting piece of social commentary was when the cells were dumping the memories that Reilly deems as unimportant. Some of those said memories were the presidents of the United States such as JohnQuincy Adams or Andrew Jackson. This brief segment of the film is a reflection of the ongoing short attention span that the younger generation has towards academia. The newer generations are more prone to being distracted by forms of media and showing less of an interest in studies.As a final note, “Inside Out” is a proud return to form film by Pixar that not only has a good piece of social commentary but it is also a reflection on hoe all emotions are needed even if they are negative.

"Do you wanna learn about your mind in a more entertaining and still efficient way? Disney and Pixar have a great answer for you: five charismatic characters who, together with other interesting faces, control the cute Riley and teach us how our mind works. Inside Out explores all the mysterious and funny places of our head in order to show us that everything works together. Being happy is important but being sad, angry, disgusted and scared are part of our lives too and make us who we are. This is an amazing film not only for kids but to everyone else. It's common to forget essential things like the one that and being reminded of it in such an amusing and touching way is priceless.",Inside Out,Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures,"June 19, 2015","['Adventure', 'Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Comedy', 'Animation', 'Family']",10,danipp,"Jun 20, 2015",https://www.metacritic.com/movie/inside-out-2015/user-reviews
